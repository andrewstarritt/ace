The general format of a command is a single letter, followed zero, one or
more arguments:

X[-] [repeat] [qualifier]                         -- non text based commands
X[-] [search_limit] /text/ [repeat] [qualifier]   -- text based commands

White space is ignored. The text argument only applies to string related
commands such as F (for Find text) or I (for Insert text). The search limit
is an optional integer extending or restricting the default number of lines
that are searched for the specified text.

The repeat, if allowed, is optional. It specifies the number of times that
the command is to be executed.

The qualifier (also optional) is a single character, one of {'\','~','@','?'}.
'\' and '~' inverts the command success status while '@' and '?' forces a
no fail status.

'*' or '0' may be used as a combined repeat and no fail qualifier and is 
equivilent  to 50000@, i.e. essentially do many times as possible, but do
not fail.

Special commands are preceeded by a %, and in general do not affect the
the contents of the file. %C Closes the edit session.

Compound commands may be formed by grouping other commands  in parentheses
Eg: (mk)*  -- this removes every other line from the file (upto line 100000)
