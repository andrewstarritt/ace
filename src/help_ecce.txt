The main difference between ACE and ECCE that I have identified are:

Special Commands
ECCE does not allow regular commands and special commands to be mixed
in the same command line. ACE does allow commands to be mixed.

Searching Backwards
In ACE F- leaves the cursor before the start of the text as "viewed" from 
the start of the file, while in ecce leaves the cursor before text as "viewed" 
with respect to the direction of search, i.e. after the search text.

In ACE T- leaves the cursor after the end of the text as "viewed" from the
start of the file, while in ecce leaves the cursor after text as "viewed" 
with respect to the direction of search, i.e. before the search text.

ACE  F-/.../  is equivilent to  ECCE  T-*/.../
ACE  T-/.../  is equivilent to  ECCE  F-1/.../


Left and Right. 
While ECCE interprets L- as R  and interprets R- as L,  ACE does not.

Upper/Lower Case
ACE provides command to convert up upper case (H) and to lower case (H-).
ECCE uses C for upper case, and C- for upper case backwards

Qualifiers
ECCE Uses '\' and '?' to invert the command success and forces a no fail 
status repectively. ACE allows these, however also allows '~' and '@'
for invert and no fail repectively.
[On the GEC 4000 series both '\' and '?' where special characters.]

Comments
ACE Allows comments on the commands stream introduced by unquoted '#' or ';'

Repeat Last Command
ECCE repeats the last command N times when the sole entry on the command line 
is an integer number. ACE does not, hoewever ACE does provide command history
and command editing à la bash.


Size/Implementation
ECCE is 1863 lines,  885 statements, of C code, while 
ACE  is 4177 lines, 1424 statements, of C++ code.

Note:
ECCE - Edinburgh Compatible Context Editor
ACE  - ACE Context Editor
